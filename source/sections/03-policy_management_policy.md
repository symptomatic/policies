3. Symptomatic employees may request changes to policies using the following process:
  1. The Symptomatic employee initiates a policy change request by creating an [Issue in GitHub project](https://github.com/symptomatic/policies/issues). The change request may optionally include a GitHub pull request from a separate branch or repository containing the desired changes.
  2. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to review the policy change request.
  3. Once the review is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.
  4. If the review is approved, the Security Officer then Closes the Issue, adding any pertinent notes required.
  5. If the policy change requires technical modifications to production systems, those changes are carried out by authorized personnel using Symptomatic's [change management process (ยง9.4)](#9.4-changing-existing-systems).

4. All policies are made accessible to all Symptomatic workforce members. The current master policies are published at [https://github.com/symptomatic/policies](https://github.com/symptomatic/policies).
   * Changes are automatically communicated to all Symptomatic team members of the Symptomatic GitHub Organization.
   * The Security Officer also communicates policy changes to all employees via email. These emails include a high-level description of the policy change using terminology appropriate for the target audience.

5. All policies, and associated documentation, are retained for 6 years from the date of its creation or the date when it last was in effect, whichever is later
   1. Version history of all Symptomatic policies is done via GitHub.
   2. Backup storage of all policies is done with DropBox and/or Google Docs.
