## 3.2 Maintenance of Policies


6. The policies and information security policies are reviewed and audited annually, or after significant changes occur to Symptomatic's organizational environment. Issues that come up as part of this process are reviewed by Symptomatic management to assure all risks and potential gaps are mitigated and/or fully addressed. The process for reviewing polices is outlined below:
  1. The Security Officer initiates the policy review by creating an Issue in the JIRA Compliance Review Activity (CRA) project.
  2. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to review the current Symptomatic policies ([https://policy.Symptomatic.com/](https://policy.Symptomatic.com/)).
  3. If changes are made, the above process is used. All changes are documented in the Issue.
  4. Once the review is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue. If the Issue is rejected, it goes back for further review and documentation.
  5. If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.
  6. Policy review is monitored on a quarterly basis using JIRA reporting to assess compliance with above policy.

7. Symptomatic utilizes the HITRUST MyCSF framework to track compliance with the HITRUST CSF on an annual basis. Symptomatic also tracks compliance with HIPAA and publishes results at [https://hipaa.Symptomatic.com](https://hipaa.Symptomatic.com). In order to track and measure adherence on an annual basis, Symptomatic uses the following process to track HITRUST audits, both full and interim:
  1. The Security Officer initiates the HITRUST audit activity by creating an Issue in the JIRA Compliance Review Activity (CRA) project.
  2. The Security Officer or the Privacy Officer is assigned to own and manage the HITRUST activity.
  3. Once the HITRUST activity is completed, the Security Officer approves or rejects the Issue.
  5. If the review is approved, the Security Officer then marks the Issue as Done, adding any pertinent notes required.
  6. Compliance with annual compliance assessments, utilizing the HITRUST CSF as a framework, is monitored on a quarterly basis using JIRA reporting to assess compliance with above policy.
