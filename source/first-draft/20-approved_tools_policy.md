# 20. Approved Tools Policy

Symptomatic utilizes a suite of approved software tools for internal use by workforce members. These software tools are either self-hosted, with security managed by Symptomatic, or they are hosted by a Subcontractor with appropriate business associate agreements in place to preserve data integrity.  Use of other tools requires approval from Symptomatic leadership.

## 20.2 List of Approved Development Tools

To start with the Clinical Meteor Software Development Kit, we're going to need to set up a complete development environment.  There's a large ecosystem of tools to use, so the focus in this document is on tools that are known to work together well on Mac OSX and are popular within the Meteor community.   

**App Development**  
* [Meteor](https://www.meteor.com/) - Isomorphic javascript/node environment.  
* [GitHub Desktop App](https://desktop.github.com/) - For synchronizing and managing code.    
* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) - Editor with support for large files (genomics, big data) and good javascript refactoring tools.  

**Platform Development**    
* [Java 8](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk8-downloads-2133151.html) - Needed QA testing tools.  
* [Node JS](http://nodejs.org/en/) - Server-side javascript environment. Use the LTS release.    
* [Visual Studio - Community 2017](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) - C++ compilers needed for some Node libraries.    

**Chrome Environment**    
Clinical Meteor prefers a Chrome environment.  So much so, that its arguably an alternative Chrome OS.  Not only will we be targeting Chrome as our preferred browser; we'll also be installing utilities as Chrome extensions; using a code editor built on Chrome, and using Chrome in our QA test runner.  Clinical Meteor supports other browsers (particularly Firefox and Safari), but the bulk of it's work is done with Chrome.  Once you get Chrome installed, we recommend the following extensions; which will help develop Clinical Meteor apps.  

* [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/desktop/) - Prefered web browser.  
* [Postman HTTP/REST Utility](https://www.getpostman.com/) - HTTP protocol utility for programming REST interfaces.  
* [MeteorDevTools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/meteor-devtools/ippapidnnboiophakmmhkdlchoccbgje) - Blaze, DDP, and Minimongo debugging utilities.

**Database Management**    
* [MongoDB](ww.mongodb.com) - JSON database for big data applications.
* [Robomongo](http://robomongo.org/) - A sweet, sweet database management tool for MongoDB.  

**Communications**  
* [Signal]()  
* [VPN Software]()
